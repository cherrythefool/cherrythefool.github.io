    <h1>&#128681 Minesweeper Treasure Hunt &#128165</h1>
    <h2 id=”top”> Story</h2>
        <p>You've spent decades decoding texts and consulting historians and experts, and you have finally deciphered the ancient, disintegrating map passed down from your great-grandparents. But the map leads to an old minefield...<br><br>
            Welcome, treasure hunter! <br> 
            I'm protector of these lands, but the last time I've had a treasure hunter was here was before the war.<br>
            You're a welcome guest here, but be careful!
            I've made progress clearing away the ordnance left behind, but who knows? ...there's probably at least one mine left. <br>
            I'll do what I can to protect you but this is dangerous business!
        </p>

    <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>  
            Search the grid squares in the 3 meter by 3 meter area of the minefield below by clicking the area you think may have the treasure. <br>
            The protector of the land will mark neutral squares with a red flag after you've searched, indicating that there are no mines there.<br>
            Win the treasure (and the game!) by finding the square containing the treasure. <br>
            But click the mine...and it's game over.<br>
            If you search too long without finding anything, the protector will move you to a new field to prevent you from hitting a mine.
        </p>
