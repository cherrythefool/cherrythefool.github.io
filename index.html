    <h1>&#128681 Minesweeper Treasure Hunt &#128165</h1>
    <h2> Story</h2>
        <p>You have been searching for gold with an ancient map which has been disintegrating. But the map leads to an old minefield...<br><br>
            Welcome, treasure hunter! <br> 
            I'm glad you're here, the last treasure hunter to search this land has been out cold for a week with a concussion.<br>
            I thought we'd cleared those mines...<br>
            Luckily, there's only one area of the minefield that hasn't been searched.<br>
            I don't think there are any mines there, but who  knows? Actually...there's probably at least one mine left. <br>
            Well, let's look for treasure!
        </p>

    <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>  
            Search the grid squares in the 3 meter by 3 meter area of the minefield below by clicking the square you think may have the treasure. <br>
            Win the treasure (and the game!) by finding the square containing TREASURE. <br>
            But click the mine...and it's game over.
        </p>
